# Charlie Miller's Digital Portfolio

This is a portfolio I am currently creating in JSX using React.js. Small bits of HTML and CSS are also used in this.

Currently, I have a few different pages, each listed below:

## Home Page:

This page is designed in the style of a desktop interface.
There is a toggle present which can switch the interface from
a classic desktop (reminiscent of macOS System 1), and a modern desktop
such as macOS 14 or Windows 11. There are multiple folders present on
this home screen. Each opens a window that corresponds with its icon. Each
window has the ability for the users to "expand" into the actual page which
contains the information described by the icons and by the window itself.

## About Me Page:

This page is meant to look like a Git repository, with branches splitting off of
the main branch that describe various aspects of myself, such as my hometown and
my interests.

## Projects Page:

This page looks like a transit map. As the user scrolls, the intent is for the user
to navigate by various transportation methods to the next station stop, where a project
will be revealed, with all of its corresponding information. This is similar to the
window on the home screen, and the user can choose to expand the project into the
full screen if they wish.

## Contacts Page:

This page is designed to highlight the design aspect of my skills, and features
a toggle where the user can switch between 4-5 different designs for the elements
on the screen.
