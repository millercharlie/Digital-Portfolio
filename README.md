## Introduction

This is a portfolio I am currently creating in JSX using React.js. Small bits of HTML and CSS are also used in this.

Currently, I have a few different pages, each listed below:

## Home Page:

This page is designed in the style of a desktop interface.
There is a toggle present which can switch the interface from
a classic desktop (reminiscent of macOS System 1), and a modern desktop
such as macOS 14 or Windows 11. There are multiple folders present on
this home screen. Each opens a window that corresponds with its icon. Each
window has the ability for the users to "expand" into the actual page which
contains the information described by the icons and by the window itself. The
user may also close the window if they wish.

## About Me Page:

This page is meant to look like a Git repository, with branches splitting off of
the main branch that describe various aspects of myself, such as my hometown and
my interests. Users are able to click on underlined text which will bring up more
information about the text they clicked on.

## Projects Page:

This page initially displays a concrete platform with pillars descending to the forested ground below. 
As the user scrolls, a randomized bullet train appears and centers itself. Scroll is translated horizontally
rather than vertically. The user continues to scroll until a train station appears. When they arrive at the station,
a window pops up which reveals the first project, which the user can scroll through. This pattern continues through
the other projects as well. The user also has the option to immediately go to the project window without scrolling.

#### The bullet/high-speed trains are as follows:

- Avelia Liberty
  - This train is Amtrak's latest rolling stock for their Acela service that runs along the Northeaster Corridor, which spans from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington, DC.
- MBTA Commuter Rail:
  - This train is the newest of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Commuter Rail service. All trains that run this service are diesel.
- California High-Speed Rail:
  - This train comes from renders of California High-Speed Rail rolling stock provided by the California High-Speed Rail Authority.
- Caltrain:
  - Caltrain recently electrified with new Stadler KISS Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) trains. These units will see more and more service with the legacy diesel rolling stock being used for the San Jos√© to Gilroy section of the route. 
- Brightline West:
  - Brightline West promises to bring high-speed rail from Greater Los Angeles to Las Vegas. This train is the Siemens American Pioneer 220 model, and renders were also used for its design on this website. 

## Contacts Page:

This page is designed to highlight the design aspect of my skills, and features
a toggle where the user can switch between 4-5 different designs for the elements
on the screen.

## Design Portfolio Page:

My design portfolio is more simple and less gimmicky. 9 of my best designs are showcased in a grid, with the background depicting outer space. More planets and objects will be added in the future, along with some animations!
