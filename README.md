## Introduction

This is a portfolio I am currently creating in JSX using React.js. Small bits of HTML and CSS are also used in this.

Currently, I have a few different pages, each listed below:

## Home Page:

This page is designed in the style of a desktop interface.
There is a toggle present which can switch the interface from
a classic desktop (reminiscent of macOS System 1), and a modern desktop
such as macOS 14 or Windows 11. There are multiple folders present on
this home screen. Each opens a window that corresponds with its icon. Each
window has the ability for the users to "expand" into the actual page which
contains the information described by the icons and by the window itself.

## About Me Page:

This page is meant to look like a Git repository, with branches splitting off of
the main branch that describe various aspects of myself, such as my hometown and
my interests.

## Projects Page:

This page initially displays a concrete platform with pillars descending to the forested ground below. 
As the user scrolls, a randomized bullet train appears and centers itself. Scroll is translated horizontally
rather than vertically. The user continues to scroll until a train station appears. When they arrive at the station,
a window pops up which reveals the first project, which the user can scroll through. This pattern continues through
the other projects as well. The user also has the option to immediately go to the project window without scrolling.

#### The bullet/high-speed trains are as follows:

- Avelia Liberty
  - This train is Amtrak's latest rolling stock for their Acela service that runs along the Northeaster Corridor, which spans from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington, DC.
- MBTA Commuter Rail:
  - This train is the newest of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Commuter Rail service. All trains that run this service are Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) trains.
- Shinkansen:
  - The quintessential bullet trainâ€“this rolling stock is the flagship of the Shinkansen service Japan runs throughout the country.

## Contacts Page:

This page is designed to highlight the design aspect of my skills, and features
a toggle where the user can switch between 4-5 different designs for the elements
on the screen.
